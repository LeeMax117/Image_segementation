# TARGET
develop a systerm which can do segementation task on any kind of pictures. We will train this nurel network with openning data set.

## Iteration 1 (2 weeks)
* establish a github project to record our work and comments.
 >- which allow anyone in porject to submit their code and comments(deadline: 5/6)

* each of the project members will learn Pytorch by themself(deadline: 5/8)
 >- prepare the env.

* discuss the FCN and MASK rcnn(deadline:5/13)

* establish the systerm framwork for segement(5/19)


## Iteration 2 (2 weeks)
* Tranning network

## Iteration 3 (2 weeks)
* use the latest outcome to optimize the system
